Comparative Study of Optimisation Algorithms on Benchmark VRPTW Datasets

This study presents a comprehensive, comparative analysis of heuristic and metaheuristic approaches for solving the Vehicle Routing Problem with time windows. These algorithms are compared using Solomon and Gehring & Homberger benchmarks. Our algorithms chosen are Simulated Annealing and a hybrid of Insertion heuristic and Earliest Deadline First the evaluation uses the best-known solutions from each of the benchmarks. Descriptive statistics were computed after normality testing took place via Shapiro-Wilk test, Inferential tests took place including the non-parametric Mann-Whitney U test and Welchâ€™s t-test confirming variance inequality with bartletts test. These tests revealed statistically significant differences in performance across datasets. Importantly SA on the Solomon achieved gap percentages from best known between 0-10% showing near optimal performance. Whereas IEDF on Solomon fell slightly behind ranges between 50-80%. Although both algorithms struggled on the larger Homberger dataset highlighting the challenges posed by more complex instances.
